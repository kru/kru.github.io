    <p>Working at my previous company had been an incredible journey spanning nearly five years. I wasn&rsquo;t a direct hire but had the privilege of being part of the team through an agency. The company, known for its nurturing work environment, had all the elements conducive to personal and professional growth. The workload was balanced, my co-workers were not just colleagues but friends, and the salary, particularly in a developing country like mine, was more than satisfactory.</p>
<p>I began my journey there as a junior-to-mid-level engineer, surrounded by more seasoned professionals. However, with unwavering dedication and a commitment to giving my best, I embarked on a gradual ascent up the corporate ladder, reaching the coveted position of a mid-to-senior-level engineer. Then, one fine day, a significant change occurred. Our engineering manager decided to restructure the team, dividing it into three distinct units. Each team was tasked with managing its own set of services, and to my delight, I was selected to lead one of these teams. This recognition came with a modest raise, courtesy of my agency, which I graciously accepted.</p>
<p>Under my leadership, we embarked on an exciting journey, successfully crafting a product that garnered not just attention but genuine affection from its users. It became an indispensable tool, one that our clients relied on daily to conduct their business operations.</p>
<p>As time flowed steadily, the peaceful days at my workplace came to an unexpected changes, giving way to an unsettling reality. The first whispers of layoffs had begun to circulate, emanating from the behemoth corporations that had long seemed impervious to economic turbulence. Initially, I believed myself immune to this impending storm, after all, I held a leadership position within my team. However, as the events began to unfold, an unsettling worry began to crunch at my confidence.</p>
<p>It all commenced with a restructuring initiative, a seemingly innocuous move that would soon unravel my world. I had been overseeing a team of four talented individuals, each of whom reported directly to me. However, with the restructuring, a sudden and cruel twist of fate severed my team members from the organization, leaving me standing alone amidst the shifting sands of change. While our services remained stable, albeit with a few imperfections, there were still low-priority bugs that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>With remarkable agility, I was reassigned to lend a helping hand to another team. My adaptability and comprehensive knowledge of our systems made me a versatile asset, capable of sliding into new roles with ease. And so, I embarked on this new chapter.</p>
<p>Then, exactly two months ago, in the dead of night while I was engrossed in debugging a critical production issue for the team I had been dispatched to help, a message arrived from a representative of my agency. A shiver ran down my spine even before I opened the chat. I forced myself to postpone the inevitable, concentrating my energy on the bug I was determined to conquer. Almost 40 agonizing minutes passed before I finally allowed myself to read the message. The first sentence, stark and unadorned, read, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My subconscious mind had anticipated the grim news long before my eyes had reached the message&rsquo;s bitter conclusion. The agency representative conveyed to me that my contract with the team would conclude the following month. The words hit me like a tidal wave, and sadness washed over me as I contemplated nearly five years spent at that organization. But underneath the sadness, anxiety began to take root. A swarm of talented individuals from the colossal companies had suddenly become my competitors. It wasn&rsquo;t that I lacked confidence in my abilities; rather, I was acutely aware that the path to securing a new position would be fraught with unprecedented challenges.</p>
<p>Embracing the new reality, I knew that acceptance to the layoff was the first step. It is time to explore fresh opportunities. An intriguing offer came my way, one that extended an invitation to demonstrate my skills through a comprehensive assessment. Brimming with confidence, I accepted the challenge without a second thought. Little did I know that this test would become a humbling experience, shaking the very foundations of my self-assurance.</p>
<p>In the wake of that assessment, my optimism crumbled, replaced by a daunting sense of inadequacy. It was as if I had suddenly been thrust into the shoes of a novice, unable to navigate the programming challenges that had once been my daily bread and butter. The assessments I encountered were at a level far beyond anything I had previously encountered (MAANG level companies).</p>
<p>Yet, here I sit, resolute and determined, in front of my computer, grappling with problems that have pushed the boundaries of my knowledge. I firmly believe that I can conquer this adversity and secure a job that will provide for my family. In the interim, I am committed to sharing my journey and progress, for it is through our trials and tribulations that we often discover our true strengths and resilience.</p>
