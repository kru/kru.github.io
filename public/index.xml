      <description>I have been using Linux for more than a decade, I mostly tweaking my dev environment to gain better productivity. These are my must have apps for my dev machine: zsh, neovim, alacritty, tmux, sublime, tailscale. There is a reason I have two text editors, sublime is really good at opening big files, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it until neovim can handle big files.&#xA;Ubuntu and Gnome has been always become my first choice of DE, it just works, ui feels intuitive, and looks good.</description>

      <description>This week, I found myself engrossed in a series of YouTube videosâ€”not the usual technical fare, but rather a collection of career advice and broader insights into software development. It was one of those late-night excursions into the world of online content. After I&amp;rsquo;d concluded my viewing, I decided it was time to call it a night and prepared to retire to bed. Yet, as I lay there, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake off the lingering curiosity, so I reached for my trusty iPad and absently refreshed my video suggestions.</description>

      <description>It has been a month since the unexpected layoff, and my journey to find a new opportunity has been nothing short of challenging. The job market is more competitive than ever, with resume filtering becoming increasingly stringent, making it even harder to secure initial interviews. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a significant shift in the hiring process, with many companies now incorporating competitive programming problems into their assessments.&#xA;While I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for everyone, I want to share my personal experience.</description>

      <description>Working at my previous company had been an incredible journey spanning nearly five years. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a direct hire but had the privilege of being part of the team through an agency. The company, known for its nurturing work environment, had all the elements conducive to personal and professional growth. The workload was balanced, my co-workers were not just colleagues but friends, and the salary, particularly in a developing country like mine, was more than satisfactory.</description>
