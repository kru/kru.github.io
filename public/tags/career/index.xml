      <description>This week, I found myself engrossed in a series of YouTube videosâ€”not the usual technical fare, but rather a collection of career advice and broader insights into software development. It was one of those late-night excursions into the world of online content. After I&amp;rsquo;d concluded my viewing, I decided it was time to call it a night and prepared to retire to bed.
