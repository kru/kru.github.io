There are some promising system programming languages other than C/C++, and they have been around for a while.
I have tried some of them and finally decided to give Odin language sometimes.
My approach to a language is simple, I see some examples and then tried make them myself.
Here are the top three of I like about the language:

* Procedural (this is the most important to not overcomplicated program)
* Syntax is really close to Go (simple and easy to read).
* There are bindings to some cross-platform graphics API (Raylib, OpenGL, SDL, Vulkan, etc)
* Language design seems really pragmatic and practical

A typical Odin program will look like the following:

I tried to create a very simple game and some additional examples to get a grasp of the language.

Here is the full source code [github](https://github.com/kru/odin-examples/blob/master/raylib/odinbreak/game.odin)

You can run it using the following command:

```
odin run .
```
