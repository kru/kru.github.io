Crafting a Neovim theme takes times, You don't have to do it from scratch.
I have tried several mainstream themes, such as tokyo-night, rose-pine, kanagawa, catpuccin, gruvbox, etc. Those themes are awesome and crafted beautifully by their maker, but I need a theme with personal touch. So, I take a look at Gruvbox theme then modify it slightly according to my need.

I name it Judo, here is how its look like at a glance.
