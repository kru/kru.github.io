In a real life, the way of how do you handle failure will resemble on how you are handle program errors (network, exception, etc), unconsiously.
It is not obvious and absurd if we try to correlate them. But, then again, our behaviour and environment will impact on how do we think about
a problem. For an instance, the way you think about healthiness will matter in the long run. you'll think unconciously if you want to eat something not healthy, there is a rejection or warning from your brain.
