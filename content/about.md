## Hi, It's me Kris

I'm a Software Engineer who love to tinker with low level stuff (mostly FPGA, Arduino, computer graphics and computer architecture).

There is blog section in this page, it purposely to note what I learned in my journey and as a reference for myself. That said, It won't be a comprehensive source. I do my best to add detailed post of my knowledge at time I write it.

You want to get connected? feel free to connect to my social media [here](https://kris-dev.cloud).
